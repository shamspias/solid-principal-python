"Solid" is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented software design, which were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book "Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices."

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.

Here in ``` srp``` the class Journal has only one responsibility which is maintaining journal entries and providing add and remove entry functionality. PersistenceManager is responsible for saving the journal entries to a file. This way if the requirement changes or any bug found in file saving, it would not affect the Journal class and the changes would be in the PersistenceManager only.


**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Here, the `Shape` class is open for extension (new classes can inherit from it, such as `Square` and `Circle`), but closed for modification (we don't need to change the Shape class in order to add new shapes).

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
